Review 32: My daughter loves her gift.
-----------------------
Review 33: Beautiful
-----------------------
Review 34: I just got it, but i looks in good condition as of now.  It was in a little plastic zip bag. For the price you should definitely get a box. Some of us buy these as gifts so i can't just gift it in that cheap bag. If you are buying for yourself and don't care for the box it's a good buy. The customer service in regards to the box issue was great and will definitely continue purchasing.

Review 41: No box! Came in clear plastic only. I thought that was weird! Pandora box should have came with it for that price. Better off going to the actual store. I kept one of the bracelets. I‚Äôm sending one of the back! I purchased a gold one. I will up date in new one.

-----------------------
Review 54: It definitely beat going into the Pandora store fighting through the mall traffic Gift came nicely wrapped in a Pandora box. I was surprised to see that there were no cross charms to choose from. Does Pandora not make cross charms? Or any Christian charms

    ¬†Very beautiful the quality is very good just as they describe will be ordering more for my friends and family
-----------------------
Review 69: She called to say she loved her gift with the heart clasp. I have a 11 and  12 year old grand daughters who hasve a 6.5inch  wrist . Added ,8 inches as instructed ,bought a 7.5 inch bracelet , fit perfect. Thank you
-----------------------
Review 70: Sizing was a little challenging but a beautiful piece.
-----------------------
Scraping page 8
Review 71: I haven't been able to wear the bracelet yet
-----------------------
Review 72: When I received the bracelet I was rather surprised at how small it was.  Do you sell extender pieces?  Also, there were no instructions as to how to open the heart clasp and it was a good thing that my son was able to show me how to open it and how to put a charm on the bracelet.
-----------------------
Review 73: Excelente pulsera. L√°stima que enviaron una talla m√°s grande que la que compr√©. Debi√≥ ser de 6'7  y enviaron de 7'9
-----------------------
Review 74: Love love
-----------------------
Review 75: So I got this for myself for Christmas after the one I ordered from Pandora came and was too small. I also ordered some charms directly from Pandora before and after I received the bracelet‚Ä¶ I noticed that the bracelet was turning black a couple of days ago and tried to clean it using silver cleaner. The black has persisted and started to spread and clearly it is too late to return and ask for a refund. Very disappointed but will stick to Pandora directly for their products from now on‚Äô
-----------------------
Review 76: Happy at first but within a couple of weeks the clasp started to open a few times a day. This got to the point that it would just pop open all the time. Tried to do a warranty through Pandora but so far no luck
-----------------------
Review 77: Si muy lindo lo utilizo para mi
-----------------------
Review 78: It‚Äôs perfect for me due to my arm is very very small. Just use the size chat .
-----------------------
Review 79: This is a holiday gift for a family member so sturdiness and value are yet to be determined. But the bracelet is so beautiful, I would purchase one for myself!
-----------------------
Review 80: It is a good quality
-----------------------
Scraping page 9
Review 81: Super bonita
-----------------------
Review 82: My daughter loved it but it was too big for her. When I was trying to exchange it I would have to pay more then what I paid for. So I just returned it and bought the same one on Pandora website and the price was better.
-----------------------
Review 83: Da comez√≥n.
-----------------------

Review 1: Wow, I wore this in Barbados this past week! I called it my ‚Äúbad like a Barbie‚Äù look. So many stares and compliments. My boyfriend loved it! I was comfortable and cute. It is short so if you aren‚Äôt comfortable with that avoid it. I got a Med and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6inches 149-152 pounds (athletic curvy built) size up if you aren‚Äôt totally comfortable with tight size down for a sexier look!
-----------------------
Review 2: I needed something quick for a party I‚Äôm going to. I was a little hesitant due to some reviews talking about the quality and sizing, but overall I would say it‚Äôs a good purchase. There‚Äôs good stretch to it and I don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs going to rip at the seams. The material is stretchy and not thick, but not see through. I love the color as well. Obviously I don‚Äôt expect this outfit to last, but I would wear it on multiple occasions.For reference: 4‚Äô11, 120 lbs, 32 B, 25 waist
-----------------------
Review 3: Adorable strapless top with slight skits on the sides that did not fall/roll down and the skirt has a thicker band but, it doesn‚Äôt stick out in the back. It clung tightly to my body so I don‚Äôt think sizing down is necessary unless you truly want a skin tight fit. The strings that you use to hang the top up were the only dislike because they were constantly coming out but, the obvious solution is to simply cut them out.  I love how thick and heavy the material is without causing sweating or rubbing. I do think this is something you could wear during multiple seasons because it seems to work with your body heat and not against it. These pieces would work well individually you can definitely get multiple wears out of it!
-----------------------
Review 4: I‚Äôm absolutely OBSESSED with this set! I was in between going with an x-small or small, but so glad I went with an x-small. It‚Äôs super stretchy and even with an x-small I still had room to breathe. I love that you can wear it two different ways, either with the longer part of the shirt in front to look like a dress or with the shorter part of the shirt in front to look like the 2 piece set that it is. I also love that it‚Äôs super thick and not see-through, like most other white sets I get. I‚Äôm so happy with this and can‚Äôt wait to wear it out ü§©üíï
-----------------------
Review 5: My daughter loves this dress but the skirt did have a seam that was apart. We had to sew it because we had nothing else handy at the moment to wear.  Love the pink!
-----------------------
Review 6: Love this set. After reading some reviews, i decided to purchase a small when i usually am a medium. I should have stuck with my normal size, the waistband is a little tight for my comfort. But i have smaller boobs and didn‚Äôt want any issues keeping up the top. Top fits perfect!
-----------------------
Review 7: Only giving four stars because I haven‚Äôt actually wore it yet. But as soon as I took it out of the package, I ran to write a review. The quality is amazing. It‚Äôs thick and very sturdy. I got an xsmall because I wanted it to fit a little bit tighter and I‚Äôm so glad I did because there is a ton of stretch! Even holding it up to my body make me excited because you can just tell it‚Äôs going to eat. If you‚Äôre considering, buy it!
-----------------------
Review 8: POR: I‚Äôm a 28‚Äù and (M)  6/8 in PrettyLittleThingLove this two piece set! The material is really good and stretchy & the skirt is long enough to pull down just enough where you won‚Äôt have to worry about the skirt rising up after a few steps. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs true to size . If you want an even more snatched fit, you could size down a size since it is stretchy  enough
-----------------------
Review 9: Comfortable and cute
-----------------------
Review 10: If you‚Äôre more curvy I think this would look really good. I‚Äôm still keeping it because it doesn‚Äôt look bad from the front. I got XS when I usually get a S just so the top wouldn‚Äôt fall down and I‚Äôm glad that I did so I would consider sizing down. The fabric is thick and I would air dry it after washing. I‚Äôm giving it four stars because i don‚Äôt like the back side of the top that much. Where the top touches the bottom just seem a little weird or feels weird.

Review 11: More reviews on my IG @lem0nmermaideI love this set, I got it in 3 more colors because I am obsessed. It‚Äôs such nice quality and so comfortable. You can also wear the skirt and top separately with other outfits.I originally got a small but then decided to size down to an extra small and so happy that I did. I am 5‚Äô8 and 157-160 lbs athletic build.
-----------------------
Review 12: I'm 5 ft 120 lbs 32B and bought a small but this was a TIGHTTT squeeze. Honestly, Instagram/TikTok make me buy this. Material is actually nice and thick instead of the typical flimsy see thru stuff. Size up if you want to breathe and be able to walk and sit normally!

    ¬†Bought this for a girl‚Äôs trip to Vegas. For reference, I am 5‚Äô1, 185 lbs. I got a size large. I loved how it flattered my body. I felt very confident in it and got a lot of compliments from my friends. I also like how you can wear the top and skirt separately on different occasions. I didn‚Äôt wear a bra with the top, but I still felt secure. I loved how good the material felt, like good quality, def not see through. The only downside is that sometimes the top would start falling and the skirt would start riding up. I think it‚Äôs cause I was walking a lot, so overall I‚Äôd say try it out for yourself bc it‚Äôs super cute!
-----------------------
Review 14: This set was super cute and comfy. Got it to see the Barbie movie. Be careful pulling the material it ripped when I accidentally pulled it a little hard.
-----------------------

Review 32: I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 wearing size small :)
-----------------------
Review 33: This set in pink is breathtaking. It‚Äôs a thick material, easy to wash and has a nice grip on your body. I recommend washing inside else it started to get a few fuzz balls.
-----------------------
Review 34: I was not a fan of this set. It was not flattering and the fabric was not conducive to wearing undergarments or shapewear. Its very sheer.
-----------------------
Review 35: Good material. wore it to the club and such a cute outfit with the heels
-----------------------
Review 36: Hey girlies! I absolutely loved this outfit. First of all its super strechy so size down. The color is super vibrant and its super comfortable. You can wear this two piece literally everywhere, at the beach or even at dinner. Overall I recommend. 10/10!
-----------------------
Review 37: Only complaint is that i wish the top had something to stay up. But overall, super comfortable & cute!
-----------------------
Review 38: this set is super cute! looks just like the pics, very comfy, true to size. I‚Äôm 130 lbs, size 26 in pants, usually wear a small in tops, b cup. Size small fit perfectly! it‚Äôs stretchy so i‚Äôm glad i didn‚Äôt size up.
-----------------------
Review 39: Bit of a weird fit. Material was super stretchy but felt cheap. The skirt wasn‚Äôt too bad but the top was wonky.
-----------------------
Review 40: This is a cute outfit but it‚Äôs not well made. Quality is cheap. If the fabric were thicker, then this outfit would be perfect. Nonetheless, I received many compliments but I wouldn‚Äôt wear this during the day because the cheap quality would be more noticeable.

Review 41: White fox set dupe. Really cute set got lots of compliments!!! True to sizing
-----------------------
Review 42: It had a lot of stretch and I can‚Äôt wait to wear it to the Barbie movie!!!
-----------------------
Review 43: Top didn‚Äôt stay up but 10/10
-----------------------
Review 44: Super cute, comfy, good quality, but came ripped. Ordered a replacement so hopefully I get lucky this time. Should‚Äôve listened to the reviews.
-----------------------
Review 45: This outfit is perfect. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7, 165lbs and I got a medium.
-----------------------
Review 46: the set is stunning itself, from the quality to the fitting it‚Äôs perfect. however, the top does tend to slide/fall down very easily and very often! i got my regular size M & wish i sized down!
-----------------------
Review 47: Very cute but after wearing it for less than 3 hours, the skirt ripped! I ended up making it into a slit but not ideal.
-----------------------
Review 48: Very cute, color perfect, material good. However sizing is off. I did fit into the small bug attached out a lot in my chest making the top look not so cute, if I size up it would look a lot more pit together
-----------------------
Review 49: Its sooo cute and comfy but i wore it once and it did rip alittle on the side seams :(
-----------------------
Review 50: I buy a lot from white fox and was soooo curious to see what this would be like. I love it!! It looks so cute on! I‚Äôm always a size 4-6 and went with a size small. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1‚Äù, 132 lbs with a big butt and size B/C top. Can‚Äôt wait to wear this to brunch ü•∞

Review 51: Awesome I bought Size Small!
-----------------------
Review 52: Love this set so much!! It was the perfect length, fit snug but not too tight, and the material was amazing. Not sheer at all, but not too thick that it felt heavy. I am 5‚Äô3 and weigh 126, and the small fit great. Id say I have a curvy/ athletic body type, and I am in love with this set. Will be ordering more colors!
-----------------------
Review 53: There was a rip in the seam. I didn‚Äôt try it on or stretch it out, the rip was already there. Too expensive for there to be a rip.
-----------------------
Review 54: blew my expectations away! not see thru at all super thick and great quality material! perf for din or a night out
-----------------------
Review 55: This is my favorite summer outfit! The quality is really good and very comfortable!
-----------------------
Review 56: I bought the black color, and I loved it! It was great quality, the fabric felt thick and soft. You feel hot without showing too much skin. I bought the blue color in the same size, but the blue skirt was cut shorter than the black. It also didn't hide things like the black one did, but that is not the products fault.
-----------------------
Review 57: Super flattering, it hugs the body right! Thick material but not hot at all. Perfect for date night, brunch, club you name it. Getting another color asap!
-----------------------
Review 58: Great for a night out !

Review 61: OMG, the material is so soft and great quality!!!  I was expecting this to be thin but I was so pleasantly surprised it was thicker and hugged in all the right places!  If you are in between sizes I recommend to size up.  I‚Äôm so excited to wear these staple pieces all summer, and they can be easily mixed and matched!!  The top could also be tucked under for a different look too!  If you‚Äôre on the fence, get it!

Review 62: love it love it love it...puuuuuurrrrffffect

    ¬†Nah this is so freaking cute. 5‚Äô7 150lbs I got a size small. There‚Äôs so much stretch and the material is so soft and thick. Only thing for me is the skirt does ride up in the back and because it‚Äôs so stretchy the top doesn‚Äôt have a lot of support. But other than that I loveee. Thinking about buying it in more colors!
-----------------------
Review 65: I literally loved this set, I got it in like 2 other colors, I normally wear an XS but I‚Äôm glad I got the small so it didn‚Äôt cut into my stomach!! 32DD, 25 waist, 120 lbs, 5‚Äô2!
-----------------------
Review 66: The top doesn‚Äôt stay up very well. There are many other high quality tube tops I like more.

    ¬†its fabric is soft and comfortable.  it fits perfectly to the body.  the size is indicated.  I really loved it, I would order it in all colors.
-----------------------
Review 68: I got a small - I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1 and 144pounds for reference. The material feels like butter. The color is identical to the pictures shown. Will definitely be purchasing other colors in this set!!
-----------------------
Review 69: This 2 pieces outfit are beautiful and flattering on the curves! I love the bring color (got the green). Just keep in mind it runs a little small.
-----------------------
Review 70: I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2, 110-115lbs and have a small chest. I ordered a size XS and omg‚Ä¶ it fits so wonderfully. And it‚Äôs SO comfy!!! Just buy it! Shipping took a little while but worth the wait!!!!

    ¬†It fits great! Good quality
-----------------------
Review 76: It literally ripped while I was wearing it. I believe it the stitching was better and stronger it would be perfect. I loved it so much. I ended up reversing my top with the bottom and the bottom as the top and it still pieces together well.
-----------------------
Review 77: Very pretty , the quality is great, it‚Äôs nice and thick it also fits true to size, good stretch as well
-----------------------
Review 78: This set is super cute, the sizing is accurate and it‚Äôs pretty stretchy. However the quality is kinda terrible. The skirt ripped as soon as I pulled it up my legs. Very unfortunate. I got the blue set. The top also has absolutely no support so wear with a really good bra underneath
-----------------------
Review 79: amazing qualityyyyy
-----------------------
Review 80: Fabric is extremely thin
-----------------------

Review 81: Was super excited to wear, didn‚Äôt get practically any pictures in it execpt this one and never will bc the skirt ripped taking it off!? Felt like good fabric but ripped right at the seem :/ super disappointed
-----------------------
Review 82: I‚Äôve only worn this once and now there‚Äôs a hole in it, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend buying this product.
-----------------------
Review 83: I purchased two sets from this seller, but had to return them because they are a little short for me. That being said, the seller finally sent me the return label, I mailed them back and mind you I paid $15 to send the packet back. These people sent the package back to me and put wrong address on the package. I will be contacting customer service and will never purchase from this vendor again. Shame !
-----------------------
Review 84: I went to dinner in this outfit. It fell apart within 2 hours of me sitting down! I had to get an Uber to take me home bc everyone would have seen the goods if I didn‚Äôt. As soon as I got home I took a pic.I was truly upset. The top is in tact and I‚Äôll use it in the future.
-----------------------
Review 85: This material is very cheap. I highly doubt it will survive one wash. It looks cute on the model but not so great in real life. Buy at your own risk
-----------------------
Review 86: My item was delivered with a hole in the skirt, I am not able to wear.
-----------------------
Review 87: Such a cute outfit but having to sew it right away is not fun. Very disappointing. It wasn‚Äôt cheap so I wish it was better quality.
-----------------------
Review 88: Thick material cheap stitching. Seam broke after one wear. Material constantly rides up or falls down
-----------------------
Review 89: The skirt came with a hole in it. Very disappointing as I wanted to wear my outfit for a event today!
-----------------------
Review 90: The material is cheap and the skirt ripped on the sides
-----------------------

-----------------------
Review 92: I was only sent the skirt for this outfit, no top. Very disappointed.
-----------------------
Review 93: Very cute. Thick material, but my skirt has two holes on the side.
-----------------------
Review 94: This is the PERFECT set for any occasion. The material is very high quality and extremely stretchy/comfortable. The top stays up and fits great, same with the bottoms. I love the baby blue color!
-----------------------
Review 95: It‚Äôs REALLY stretchy so it will def work for my big/curvy girls. I got a size L and my normal size is 16-18 xl-xxl. Used boob tape and some shaping shorts too and didn‚Äôt really have to worry about either one showing. The top is long enough and the skirt high waisted enough that you don‚Äôt really have a gap in the back where your skin shows. Def get it!
-----------------------
Review 96: I got a small and this fits perfectly like a glove! The material is very nice and the quality is good too. This is the perfect outfit for dinner date or brunch!
-----------------------
Review 97: Me gusto mucho su tela, lo bien que ajusta al cuerpo .no transparenta.el color es sumamente bonito
-----------------------
Review 98: I am 5‚Äù8 and 170lbs, bought the medium in apricot color. The fit was good it is stretchy and will fit your body how it is won‚Äôt snatch the body. It‚Äôs very soft material.  Had to return though because the bottoms were see thru. Maybe in a darker color the aren‚Äôt see thru.

    ¬†The cutest set - definitely on the sexier side‚Ä¶if you‚Äôre worried about that maybe size up. Great quality material!
-----------------------
Review 100: Super cute set! I love that I can mix & match with this so I feel like I‚Äôm getting more for my money! I am 4‚Äô11 on a good day 5 lol I weight 148lbs & I got a medium, this is what it looks like. I hope this was helpful!
